    The computational node for PconsC2 is fixed now. The queued jobs will be
    run gradually. However, this may take some time since we have limited
    resources at the moment. We are trying to allocate more resource soon.

    We regret to inform you that all jobs currently submitted to the 
    PconsC2 web-server are suspended due to the shutdown of the cloud 
    cluster. We will move our computational node to a new cluster and 
    the jobs submitted will stay in the queue.

    The PconC2 web-server is back to work now. All jobs will be run according to the 
    QueueRank. Due to the limitation of our computational resource, it may take quite long time
    before your job is finished.
